                        In 2017, New Consensus began originally as a project called Left Right Forward. Our goal was the same: present a new, positive worldview for how to intentionally tackle our biggest problems. To do that, we began by creating a set of YouTube  videos trying to explain in simple terms some of the fundamentals of how an economy works and why we are facing some of the big problems we face today.*
